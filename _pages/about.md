I am a PhD student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Soummya Kar](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~soummyak/).  My research interests primarily include optimization, machine learning, and distributed algorithms. Specific topics include adversarial attacks, heavy-tailed noise, and adaptive methods for transformers.

During my PhD, I interned at ByteDance Seed MLsys and Bosch Center for AI. Prior to my PhD, I received my BEng in computer science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen in May 2019, and I interned at Baidu NLP.
